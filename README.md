# TestChallenge

This app connects to The Movie Database and provides the user with the following features:
1) Film search and display the films in a UITableView. 
2) See details of the film.
3) Favourite and unfavorite a movie.
4) See a list of favourite movies (and from there go to the detail movie screen).

There is no need to install any third-party dependencies. Just open the project and you're all set.
